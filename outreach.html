    The East Palo Alto Kids Foundation (EPAK) is a community-based,
    all-volunteer organization whose mission is to promote educational
    opportunities and academic success for students in East Palo Alto and eastern
    Menlo Park by providing educator micro grants directly to teachers in the
    classroom. Shreya Kumar and Meghna Okhade, founders of GPA Enrichment, hosted
    a fundraiser for EPAK to raise money for the financially underprivileged
    students in the Ravenswood and East Menlo Park Districts, raising nearly
    $5,000.

    "Education is a stepping stone to success and we hope that with our program,
    the stone will be accessible to many other individuals, so we can maximize
    progress and innovation for the future one step at a time"	Shreya Kumar and
    Meghna Okhade talk about the global problem of education inaccessibility and
    their attempts to bridge this growing divide between the haves and the
    have-nots.
